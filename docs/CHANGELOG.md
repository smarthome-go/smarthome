## Changelog for v0.3.0

### Automations
- Added the `disable-once` option for automations
- Automations won't run the next time they would because they are skipped
- Without any change, the automation will run the next time (after the time it was skipped)
- Automations which are disabled once will have a yellow warning icon and will be hidden from the dashboard automation box
